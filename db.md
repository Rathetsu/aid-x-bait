Design a database for a mobile application (both ios and android) called aidxbait.
The app is a combination of many features

1. Store (full e-commerce setup) for physical therapy equipment, tools and accessories.
2. Exercise library that contains different protocols for all physical therapy injuries that a user can also add to cart and purchase. Each protocol has instructions of when and how often certain exercises should be performed and a video demonstration of each exercise.
3. The ability to book a home visit from a physical therapist in your area that can provide you with PT sessions at home. You purchase the sessions in packages of multiples of 6 (6, 12, 18, 24, etc). The booking experience should be similar to booking an Uber. Note that the therapists themselves will also have a mobile app where they can see their schedule and accept or reject appointment requests.
4. Online consultations: users can book a video call with a certified MD consultant to discuss their injury and get advice on what to do next. The consultations are in 4 categories; (ortho, neuro, psychiatric, nutrition). The user can choose which category they want to book a consultation in.

Note that:

1. We'll save profiles for each kind of user and forms that they have to fill in order to use certain features in the app (home visits, online consultations).
2. We'll save the user's cart and order history.
3. We'll save the user's exercise history and the protocols they have purchased.
4. We'll save the user's home visit history and the therapists they have booked.
5. We'll save the user's online consultation history and the consultants they have booked.
6. We'll save the therapist's profile and the sessions they have booked.
7. We'll save the consultant's profile and the consultations they have booked.
8. We'll save the store's inventory and the orders that have been placed.
9. We'll save the exercises and protocols that are available in the app.
10. We'll save the user's payment information.
11. We'll save the user's location and the therapists' area.
12. User isn't able to choose a certain therapist (similarly to Uber drivers) but they can request to change it.
13. All payments are done through online channels (no cash). There'll be many channels available.
